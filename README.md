# qVault - Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Vault Layer

## üß† Project Abstract

**qVault** is a modular cryptographic vault designed to future-proof decentralized assets against quantum threats. Our protocol introduces a **dual-key system** combining traditional ECDSA with **hash-based, quantum-resistant signatures** (WOTS+), ensuring long-term secure asset custody.

Our mission is to solve one of Web3's most pressing but invisible risks: **the quantum vulnerability of existing wallets and signature schemes**. By introducing a post-quantum fallback mechanism, we provide protocols, DAOs, and asset custodians an opt-in pathway to mitigate the long-term risks of quantum computing without sacrificing near-term usability or composability.

### Problem Space
- ECDSA is non-quantum secure (a quantum computer can break the Discrete Log Problem).
- Existing wallets and vaults cannot easily upgrade to quantum-safe mechanisms.
- DeFi protocols and treasuries risk **total compromise** when quantum computers become practical.

### Target Users
- Multi-chain DeFi protocols with long-term asset exposure.
- DAO treasuries and on-chain asset managers.
- Institutional custodians needing gradual quantum upgrades.
- Security-focused infrastructure and custody providers.

### Team Background
Our team consists of experts with backgrounds in:
- Advanced cryptographic research including hash-based signature schemes and post-quantum cryptography.
- Smart contract development across EVM chains and modular design.
- Applied security R&D and secure systems engineering for decentralized environments.

## üöÄ Project Description & Goals

qVault Vault introduces:
- **Dual-Key Ownership:** Users can bring their existing wallets and create a new WOTS+ key (quantum-safe fallback).
- **Quantum Fallback Layer:** Configurable privileged operations require WOTS+ signatures which remain safe in a post-quantum world.
- **Efficiency and Security:** Hash computations in EVM are cost effective. Security proofs for hash-based signatures are well bounded.

### Expected Use Cases
- Vault systems securing long-term assets with quantum-safe fallback.
- Cross-chain custody infrastructure where security outlives current cryptographic assumptions.
- DAO and treasury operations requiring robust post-quantum readiness.

### Benefits
- Strengthens long-term security for EVM-based ecosystems.
- Adaptable to other smart contract platforms supporting signature validation (EIP-1271).
- Advances the broader conversation around quantum safety in decentralized finance.
